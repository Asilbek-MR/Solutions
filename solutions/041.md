# [1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of 
each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the 
binary representation of a number.

Return the *decimal value* of the number in the linked list.

The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list.

## Example

**Example 1:**

![graph.png](./resources/39_01.png)

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:

- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed `30`.
- Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.

## Solutions

### O(1) solution

The provided code implements a function called `getDecimalValue` that 
calculates the decimal value of a binary number represented as a 
singly-linked list. Here's an analysis of the code, considering the given 
problem statement and constraints:

1. **Variable Initialization**: The algorithm initializes a variable named `number` to store the calculated decimal value. This operation has constant time complexity.
2. **Decimal Value Calculation**: The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues until the `head` node becomes `None`. Within each iteration, it performs the following steps:
   - Left Shift: The `number` is left-shifted by 1 (`number << 1`) to make room for the next bit.
   - Bitwise OR: The bitwise OR operation (`|`) is performed between the shifted `number` and the value of the current `head` node (`head.val`), which is either 0 or 1.
   - Update `head`: The `head` is updated to the next node (`head = head.next`).
   These steps are repeated until the end of the linked list is reached. Each iteration in this loop has constant time complexity.
3. **Result Return**: Finally, the algorithm returns the calculated decimal value stored in the `number` variable. This operation has constant time complexity.

Considering the given problem statement and constraints:
- The linked list is not empty.
- The number of nodes will not exceed 30.
- Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

The algorithm effectively traverses the linked list from the most significant bit (head) to the least significant bit. By performing left shifts and bitwise OR operations, it calculates the decimal value of the binary number represented by the linked list. The algorithm's performance remains efficient within these constraints. Since the number of nodes is limited to a maximum of 30, the time complexity is O(1) or constant time. The space complexity is also O(1) since the algorithm does not utilize additional memory that scales with the input size.

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(1) - Constant time complexity.
- Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.

The algorithm successfully converts the binary representation of a number stored in the linked list to its corresponding decimal value. It adheres to the given constraints, ensuring efficient computation for linked lists with a moderate number of nodes.

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        number = 0
        while head:
            number = (number << 1) | head.val
            head = head.next
        return number
```
