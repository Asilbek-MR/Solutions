# [1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of 
each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the 
binary representation of a number.

Return the *decimal value* of the number in the linked list.

The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list.

## Example

**Example 1:**

![041_01.png](./resources/041_01.png)

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:

- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed `30`.
- Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.

## Solutions

### O(1) solution in Python3

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        number = 0
        while head:
            number = (number << 1) | head.val
            head = head.next
        return number
```

The given solution uses a simple iterative approach to convert the linked list into its decimal representation.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a variable, `number`, to 0. This variable will store the decimal representation of the binary number.
2. Iterate through the linked list while `head` is not None:
   - Left shift `number` by 1 (equivalent to multiplying it by 2) to make room for the next bit.
   - Use bitwise OR (`|`) operation to set the least significant bit of `number` to the value of `head.val`.
   - Update `head` to the next node.
3. Return the final value of `number`, which represents the decimal representation of the binary number.

By shifting the bits of `number` to the left and setting the least significant bit based on the values of the linked list nodes, the algorithm constructs the decimal representation.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm iterates through the linked list once, and each iteration takes constant time.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the `number` variable.

#### Summary

The given solution converts a binary number represented by a linked list into its decimal representation. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
