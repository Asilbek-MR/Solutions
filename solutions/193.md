# [1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-difference-between-two-pairs/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy


The **product difference** between two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` is defined as `(a * b) - (c * d)`.
- For example, the product difference between `(5, 6)` and `(2, 7)` is `(5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16`.
Given an integer array `nums`, choose four **distinct** indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the **product difference** between pairs `(nums[w], nums[x])` and `(nums[y], nums[z])` is **maximized**.
Return *the **maximum** such product difference*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 34
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]
Output: 64
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.
```


## Constraints:

- `4 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def maxProductDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_1, min_2 = float("inf"), float("inf")
        max_1, max_2 = float("-inf"), float("-inf")

        for num in nums:
            if num > max_1:
                max_2 = max_1
                max_1 = num
            elif num > max_2:
                max_2 = num

            if num < min_1:
                min_2 = min_1
                min_1 = num
            elif num < min_2:
                min_2 = num

        return max_1 * max_2 - min_1 * min_2
```

The solution aims to find the maximum product difference by identifying the four largest and two smallest elements in the `nums` array. To do this, we maintain four variables to keep track of the two largest (`max_1` and `max_2`) and two smallest (`min_1` and `min_2`) elements as we iterate through the array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize `min_1`, `min_2`, `max_1`, and `max_2` to positive and negative infinity, respectively. These variables will be used to track the two smallest and two largest elements in the `nums` array.

2. Iterate through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - Check if `num` is greater than `max_1`. If it is, update `max_2` to `max_1` and `max_1` to `num`.
   - If `num` is not greater than `max_1` but is greater than `max_2`, update `max_2` to `num`.
   - Check if `num` is less than `min_1`. If it is, update `min_2` to `min_1` and `min_1` to `num`.
   - If `num` is not less than `min_1` but is less than `min_2`, update `min_2` to `num`.

3. After iterating through the entire array, calculate the maximum product difference using the two largest and two smallest elements:
   - `max_product_difference = (max_1 * max_2) - (min_1 * min_2)`

4. Return `max_product_difference` as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the `nums` array once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because the solution uses a fixed number of variables to track the two largest and two smallest elements.

#### Summary

The solution efficiently finds the maximum product difference between two pairs of distinct elements in the `nums` array by identifying the two largest and two smallest elements. It then calculates the product difference using these values and returns the result. The time complexity of the solution is linear in the size of the array, making it an efficient solution.
