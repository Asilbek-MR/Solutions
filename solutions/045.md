# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return *the head of the merged linked list*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![045_01.jpg](./resources/045_01.jpg)

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solutions

### O(n+m) solution

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        root = ListNode()
        temp = root
        
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                temp.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                temp.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            temp = temp.next
            
        temp.next = list1 if list1 else list2
        return root.next
```

The given solution uses a iterative approach to merge the two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`, into a single sorted list.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Create a new linked list with a dummy node as the root to keep track of the merged list.
2. Initialize a temporary pointer, `temp`, to the root.
3. Compare the values of the current nodes in `list1` and `list2`.
4. Append the smaller value node to the `temp.next` and move the corresponding pointer (`list1` or `list2`) to the next node.
5. Move the `temp` pointer to the next node as well.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until either `list1` or `list2` becomes `None`.
7. Append the remaining nodes of the non-empty list (`list1` or `list2`) to the end of the merged list.
8. Return the `root.next` as the head of the merged linked list.

**Analysis of Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. The algorithm iterates through both lists once to merge them.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of extra space to create the merged list and update the pointers.

**Summary**

The given solution merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list by comparing the values of nodes and splicing them together. It has a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
