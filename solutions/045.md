# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.

## Example:

**Example 1:**

![045_01.jpg](./resources/045_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

```

**Example 2:**

![045_02.jpg](./resources/045_02.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`


## Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


## Solutions

### Name of solution 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        new_head = None
        while head:
            node = head
            head = head.next
            node.next = new_head
            new_head = node
        return new_head
```

The given solution approach follows these steps:
1. Initialize a `new_head` variable to `None`.
2. Iterate over the linked list using a while loop until the head becomes `None`.
3. Inside the loop, store the current `head` node in a temporary variable `node`.
4. Update the `head` node to point to the next node in the original list.
5. Update the `next` pointer of the `node` to point to the `new_head`.
6. Update the `new_head` to be the current `node`.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the end of the linked list is reached.
8. Return the `new_head`, which will be the head of the reversed linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm iterates over the linked list once, reversing the pointers.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution reverses a singly linked list by iterating over the list and updating the pointers. It uses a temporary variable to store the current node, updates the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node, and updates the new head to be the current node. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
