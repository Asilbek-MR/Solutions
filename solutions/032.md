# [2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-students-by-their-kth-score/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

There is a class with `m` students and `n` exams. You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `score`, where each row represents one student and `score[i][j]` denotes the score the `ith` student got in the `jth` exam. The matrix `score` contains **distinct** integers only.

You are also given an integer `k`. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the `kth` (**0-indexed**) exam from the highest to the lowest.

Return *the matrix after sorting it.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![032_01.png](./resources/032_01.png)

```
Input: score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2
Output: [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]]
Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
- The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
- The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place.
- The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.

```

**Example 2:**

![032_02.png](./resources/032_02.png)

```
Input: score = [[3,4],[5,6]], k = 0
Output: [[5,6],[3,4]]
Explanation: In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam.
- The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place.
- The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.

```

## Constraints:

- `m == score.length`
- `n == score[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 250`
- `1 <= score[i][j] <= 105`
- `score` consists of **distinct** integers.
- `0 <= k < n`


## Solutions

### O(m\*log(m)) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def sortTheStudents(self, score: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        return sorted(score, key=lambda x: x[k], reverse=True)
```

The given solution sorts the matrix `score` based on the scores of students in the kth exam using the `sorted()` function and a lambda function as the key.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Use the `sorted()` function to sort the matrix `score` based on the scores in the kth exam.
   - Provide the `score` matrix as the iterable to be sorted.
   - Use a lambda function as the key to specify the sorting criterion. The lambda function takes each row `x` from the matrix and returns the score of the kth exam for that row (`x[k]`).
   - Set the `reverse` parameter to True to sort the rows in descending order based on the kth exam scores.
2. Return the sorted matrix.

The algorithm sorts the matrix `score` based on the kth exam scores of the students, in descending order.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m log m), where m is the number of rows (students) in the `score` matrix. The `sorted()` function performs a stable sorting operation with a time complexity of O(m log m).

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(m), as it creates a new list to store the sorted matrix.

#### Summary

The given solution sorts the matrix `score` based on the scores of students in the kth exam in descending order. It has a time complexity of O(m log m) and a space complexity of O(m), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
