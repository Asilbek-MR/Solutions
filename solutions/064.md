# [2391. Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-amount-of-time-to-collect-garbage/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `garbage` where `garbage[i]` represents the assortment of garbage at the `ith` house. `garbage[i]` consists only of the characters `'M'`, `'P'` and `'G'` representing one unit of metal, paper and glass garbage respectively. Picking up **one** unit of any type of garbage takes `1` minute.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `travel` where `travel[i]` is the number of minutes needed to go from house `i` to house `i + 1`.

There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house `0` and must visit each house **in order**; however, they do **not** need to visit every house.

Only **one** garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks**cannot** do anything.

Return *the **minimum** number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: garbage = ["G","P","GP","GG"], travel = [2,4,3]
Output: 21
Explanation:
The paper garbage truck:
1. Travels from house 0 to house 1
2. Collects the paper garbage at house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the paper garbage at house 2
Altogether, it takes 8 minutes to pick up all the paper garbage.
The glass garbage truck:
1. Collects the glass garbage at house 0
2. Travels from house 0 to house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the glass garbage at house 2
5. Travels from house 2 to house 3
6. Collects the glass garbage at house 3
Altogether, it takes 13 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
Since there is no metal garbage, we do not need to consider the metal garbage truck.
Therefore, it takes a total of 8 + 13 = 21 minutes to collect all the garbage.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: garbage = ["MMM","PGM","GP"], travel = [3,10]
Output: 37
Explanation:
The metal garbage truck takes 7 minutes to pick up all the metal garbage.
The paper garbage truck takes 15 minutes to pick up all the paper garbage.
The glass garbage truck takes 15 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
It takes a total of 7 + 15 + 15 = 37 minutes to collect all the garbage.

```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= garbage.length <= 105`
- `garbage[i]` consists of only the letters `'M'`, `'P'`, and `'G'`.
- `1 <= garbage[i].length <= 10`
- `travel.length == garbage.length - 1`
- `1 <= travel[i] <= 100`

## Solutions

### O(n) of solution 

```python3
class Solution:
    def garbageCollection(self, garbage: List[str], travel: List[int]) -> int:
        distances = [0]
        for index, distance in enumerate(travel, start=1):
            distances.append(distances[index-1]+distance)

        trucks = {"M": [0, 0], "P": [0, 0], "G": [0, 0]}
        for index, items in enumerate(garbage):
            for item in items:
                trucks[item][0] += 1
                trucks[item][1] = distances[index]
        return sum([truck[0]+truck[1] for truck in trucks.values()])
```

The given solution provides an efficient approach to solving the problem.

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. Create an array called `distances` to store the cumulative distances from house 0 to each house. Iterate through the `travel` array and compute the cumulative distances by adding the current distance to the previous cumulative distance. The `distances` array will have the same length as `garbage` and will store the cumulative distances up to each house.
2. Create a dictionary called `trucks` to keep track of the number of units of garbage picked up and the total travel time for each type of garbage truck. The dictionary will have keys 'M', 'P', and 'G', and each key will map to a list with two values: the number of units of garbage picked up and the total travel time.
3. Iterate through the `garbage` array using an outer loop. For each house, iterate through the characters in the assortment of garbage. Update the values in the `trucks` dictionary accordingly: increment the number of units of garbage picked up for the corresponding type of garbage, and update the total travel time to the current cumulative distance.
4. Finally, calculate the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage by summing the number of units of garbage picked up and the total travel time for each type of garbage truck.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `garbage` array. We iterate through the `garbage` array and perform constant time operations for each house.

The space complexity is O(1) because the space used by the `distances` array and the `trucks` dictionary is independent of the input size.

#### Summary

The given solution efficiently solves the problem by keeping track of the cumulative distances and the number of units of garbage picked up for each type of garbage truck. It iterates through the input arrays to update the necessary values and calculates the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage. The solution has a linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
