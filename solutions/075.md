# [617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return *the merged tree*.

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![075_01.jpeg](./resources/075_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
Output: [2,2]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `104 <= Node.val <= 104`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def merge(first, second):
            if not first and not second:
                return None

            node = TreeNode()
            node.val += first.val if first else 0
            node.val += second.val if second else 0

            node.left = merge(
                first.left if first else None,
                second.left if second else None,
            )
            node.right = merge(
                first.right if first else None,
                second.right if second else None,
            )
            return node

        return merge(root1, root2)
```

The given solution provides a recursive approach to merge two binary trees.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a recursive function `merge` that takes two nodes, one from each tree, as arguments.
2. If both nodes are None, return None as there is no node to merge.
3. Create a new node with a value that is the sum of the values of the nodes if they are not None.
4. Recursively call the `merge` function for the left child of both nodes and assign the result to the left child of the new node.
5. Recursively call the `merge` function for the right child of both nodes and assign the result to the right child of the new node.
6. Return the new node.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is the recursion depth. In the worst case, the recursion depth can be equal to the height of the tree.

#### Summary

The given solution provides a recursive approach to merge two binary trees based on specific rules for merging node values. It recursively traverses both trees and creates a new merged tree accordingly. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes and h is the height of the binary tree.

***NB***: If you want to get community points please suggest solutions in other languages as merge requests.
