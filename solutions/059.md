# [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a 
cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that 
can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, 
`pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is 
connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return 
`false`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![059_01.png](./resources/059_01.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

![059_02.png](./resources/059_02.png)


```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

![059_03.png](./resources/059_03.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

## Follow up:

Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

**Python 3**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
```

The given solution uses the Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm, to detect a cycle in the linked list. The algorithm uses two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer, that move through the linked list at different speeds.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Iterate through the linked list using the following conditions:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step forward (`slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward (`fast = fast.next.next`).
   - Check if the `slow` and `fast` pointers are equal. If they are, it means there is a cycle in the linked list, and we return `True`.
3. If the iteration completes without finding a cycle (i.e., the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the linked list or becomes `None`), we return `False`.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, the `fast` pointer needs to traverse the entire linked list to detect a cycle.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only two pointers.

#### Summary

The given solution uses the Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm to determine if a linked list has a cycle. By using two pointers that move at different speeds, we can detect a cycle by checking if the pointers meet. The time complexity of the solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).
