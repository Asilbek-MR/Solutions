# [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *all root-to-leaf paths in **any order***.
A **leaf** is a node with no children.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![089_01.jpeg](./resources/089_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```


## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
        
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        if not root: return 0

        def collect(node, current_path, paths):
            current_path.append(node.val)

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                paths.append("->".join(map(str,current_path)))

            if node.left:
                collect(node.left, current_path, paths)

            if node.right:
                collect(node.right, current_path, paths)

            current_path.pop()

        current_path, paths = [], []
        collect(root, current_path, paths)
        return paths
```

The given solution provides an approach to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a recursive helper function `collect` that takes a node, a current path, and a list to store paths.
2. If the node is None, return 0.
3. Append the value of the current node to the current path.
4. If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left and right children), join the elements of the current path using " -> " as the separator and append the resulting string to the paths list.
5. Recursively call `collect` for the left child of the node.
6. Recursively call `collect` for the right child of the node.
7. Pop the last element (current node) from the current path to backtrack.

Finally, call the `collect` function for the root of the binary tree and return the list of paths.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is the maximum recursion depth.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an approach to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree. It recursively traverses the tree, backtracking at leaf nodes to construct the paths. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes and h is the height of the binary tree.
