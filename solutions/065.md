# [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the inorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![065_01.jpg](./resources/065_01.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Follow up:

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result, stack = [], []
        curr = root
        while curr or stack:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            result.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.right

        return result
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree.

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the inorder traversal values.
2. Initialize an empty stack called `stack`.
3. Set a current node `curr` to the root of the binary tree.
4. While `curr` is not None or `stack` is not empty, do the following:
   - While `curr` is not None, push `curr` onto `stack` and update `curr` to `curr`'s left child. This step traverses to the leftmost node of the current subtree.
   - Pop the top node `curr` from `stack` and append its value to `result`. This step represents visiting the current node.
   - Set `curr` to the right child of the popped node. This step moves to the right child of the current node if it exists.
5. Return `result`, which will contain the inorder traversal values.

The solution uses an iterative approach and simulates the recursive process of an inorder traversal using a stack to store nodes.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once during the traversal.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree can be O(n) for a skewed tree, resulting in O(n) space complexity. However, for a balanced tree, the height is O(log n), resulting in O(log n) space complexity.

#### Summary

The given solution efficiently performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree using an iterative approach. It uses a stack to simulate the recursive process and stores the inorder traversal values in a list. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree and h is the height of the tree.
