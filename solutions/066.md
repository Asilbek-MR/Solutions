# [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left  of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
    
    subtree
    
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![066_01.jpg][./resources/066_01.jpg]

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

![066_02.jpg][./resources/066_02.jpg]

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        last, stack = None, []
        curr = root

        while curr or stack:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            
            curr = stack.pop()

            if last is not None and last >= curr.val:
                return False

            last = curr.val
            curr = curr.right

        return True
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to determine if a binary tree is a valid BST.

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `last` to keep track of the last visited value during the inorder traversal. Set it to `None`.
2. Initialize an empty stack called `stack`.
3. Set a current node `curr` to the root of the binary tree.
4. While `curr` is not None or `stack` is not empty, do the following:
   - While `curr` is not None, push `curr` onto `stack` and update `curr` to `curr`'s left child. This step traverses to the leftmost node of the current subtree.
   - Pop the top node `curr` from `stack` and check if its value is less than or equal to `last`. If it is, return False as it violates the BST property.
   - Update `last` to the value of the popped node.
   - Set `curr` to the right child of the popped node. This step moves to the right child of the current node if it exists.
5. If the traversal completes without returning False, return True, indicating that the binary tree is a valid BST.

The solution performs an inorder traversal of the binary tree using an iterative approach and checks if the values are in ascending order. If any value is greater than or equal to the previous value (`last`), it returns False, indicating that the binary tree is not a valid BST.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once during the inorder traversal.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree can be O(n) for a skewed tree, resulting in O(n) space complexity. However, for a balanced tree, the height is O(log n), resulting in O(log n) space complexity.

#### Summary

The given solution efficiently determines whether a given binary tree is a valid BST using an iterative approach. It performs an inorder traversal of the tree and checks if the values are in ascending order. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree and h is the height of the tree.
