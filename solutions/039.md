# [1720.Â Decode XORed Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-array/description/)

**Difficulty:** ğŸŸ¢Â Easy

There is aÂ **hidden**Â integer arrayÂ `arr`Â that consists ofÂ `n`Â non-negative integers.
It was encoded into another integer arrayÂ `encoded`Â of lengthÂ `n - 1`, such thatÂ `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. For example, ifÂ `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, thenÂ `encoded = [1,2,3]`.
You are given theÂ `encoded`Â array. You are also given an integerÂ `first`, that is the first element ofÂ `arr`, i.e.Â `arr[0]`.
ReturnÂ *the original array*Â `arr`. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
Output: [4,2,0,7,4]

```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 104`
- `encoded.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= encoded[i] <= 105`
- `0 <= first <= 105`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The algorithm aims to decode a list of encoded integers based on a given first value. Here's an analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity, considering the given constraints:

1. **Initializing Variables**: The algorithm initializes a list called `result` with a single element, `first`. This operation takes constant time and space complexity.
2. **Decoding the List**: The algorithm iterates over each element `num` in the `encoded` list. For each element, it performs the XOR operation (`^`) between `first` and `num` and updates `first` with the result. It then appends the updated `first` to the `result` list. Both the XOR operation and the list append operation have constant time complexity.
3. **Returning Result**: Finally, the algorithm returns the `result` list, which requires constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `encoded` list.
In terms of space complexity, the algorithm utilizes additional memory to store the `result` list. The size of the `result` list is determined by the length of the `encoded` list, which is n-1 according to the constraints. Hence, the space complexity is O(n).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the length of the `encoded` list.
- Space complexity: O(n) - Linear space complexity, where n is the length of the `encoded` list.

The algorithm efficiently decodes the list by performing the XOR operation between consecutive elements and updating the `first` value. It constructs and returns the `result` list with the decoded values. The algorithm's performance is within the given constraints, ensuring efficient decoding for lists of moderate size.

```python3
class Solution:
    def decode(self, encoded: List[int], first: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [first]
        for num in encoded:
            first ^= num
            result.append(first)
        return result
```
