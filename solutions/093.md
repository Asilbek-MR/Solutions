[783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return *the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![093_01.jpeg](./resources/093_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

![093_02.jpeg](./resources/093_02.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```


## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 105`


## Solutions

### O(n) iterative solution 

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minDiffInBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        last, curr = None, root
        stack = []
        minimum = float("inf")
        while curr or stack:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            if last:
                minimum = min(minimum, abs(curr.val-last.val))
            last = curr
            curr = curr.right

        return minimum 
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to find the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in a BST.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Initialize `last` to keep track of the last visited node and `curr` to the root of the BST.
2. Initialize an empty stack to traverse the BST.
3. Initialize `minimum` to infinity to keep track of the minimum difference.
4. Traverse the BST using an in-order traversal.
5. For each node, calculate the absolute difference between the current node's value and the last visited node's value. Update `minimum` with this difference if it's smaller than the current `minimum`.
6. Update `last` to the current node.
7. Move to the right child of the current node.
8. Return the minimum difference.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. We visit each node once and perform constant time operations.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the BST. In the worst case, the height of the BST can be n, so the space complexity can be O(n). However, for a balanced BST, the space complexity is O(log n).

#### Summary

The given solution provides an iterative approach to find the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in a BST. It uses an in-order traversal to traverse the BST, keeping track of the last visited node and the minimum difference. The solution runs in linear time and logarithmic space complexity for a balanced BST.
