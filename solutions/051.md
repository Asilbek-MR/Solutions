# [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` *if it is a palindrome or* `false` *otherwise.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![051_01.jpg](./resources/051_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![051_01.jpg](./resources/051_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

#### Python3

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def _find_middle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow.next if fast else slow
    
    def _reverse(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        new_head = None
        while head:
            node = head
            head = head.next
            node.next = new_head
            new_head = node
        return new_head

    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        middle = self._find_middle(head)
        reversed_head = self._reverse(middle)

        while reversed_head:
            if reversed_head.val != head.val:
                return False
            reversed_head = reversed_head.next
            head = head.next

        return True
```

The given solution approach checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome or not. It follows these steps:

1. Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Compare the reversed second half with the first half of the linked list.
4. If all the corresponding nodes in the first and second halves are equal, the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the linked list twice: once to find the middle and once to compare the first and reversed second halves.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution determines whether a singly linked list is a palindrome or not. It uses the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list and reverses the second half. Then, it compares the reversed second half with the first half to check if the linked list is a palindrome. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
