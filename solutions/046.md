# [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

- For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
- We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
- The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![046_01.jpg](./resources/046_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation:You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

```

**Example 2:**

![046_02.jpg](./resources/046_02.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation:You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is**not a tail** node.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        while node.next and node.next.next:
            node.val = node.next.val
            node = node.next
        
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = None
```

The given solution approach follows these steps:
1. Iterate through the linked list until the second last node.
2. For each iteration, update the value of the current node with the value of the next node.
3. Continue this process until the second last node.
4. Update the value of the second last node with the value of the last node.
5. Set the next pointer of the second last node to `None`, effectively deleting the last node.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we iterate through all the nodes in the list to find the second last node.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution deletes a node from a singly-linked list by iterating through the list and updating the values of the nodes. It maintains the order of the values before and after the given node while decreasing the number of nodes by one. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
