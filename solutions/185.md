# [2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a **0-indexed**, **strictly increasing** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an **arithmetic triplet** if the following conditions are met:

- `i < j < k`,
- `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`, and
- `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

Return *the number of unique **arithmetic triplets**.*


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.
```

## Constraints:

- `3 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 200`
- `1 <= diff <= 50`
- `nums` is **strictly** increasing.


## Solutions

### Naive solution

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def arithmeticTriplets(self, nums: List[int], diff: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        size = len(nums)
        for i in range(size):
            found = False
            for j in range(i+1, size):
                for k in range(j+1, size):
                    if nums[j]-nums[i] == diff and nums[k]-nums[j] == diff:
                        count += 1
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
                    
        return count
```

The given solution uses a brute-force approach to find arithmetic triplets in the `nums` array. It iterates through the array using three nested loops to check all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k`. For each triplet, it checks whether the conditions `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff` and `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff` are met. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `count` variable, which keeps track of the number of arithmetic triplets found.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a `count` variable to 0, which will store the number of unique arithmetic triplets found.

2. Iterate through the `nums` array using a loop variable `i` from 0 to `size - 1`, where `size` is the length of the array.
   - For each `i`, initialize a `found` variable to `False`, which will be used to check if an arithmetic triplet is found.

3. Inside the outer loop, iterate through the elements of the `nums` array using another loop variable `j` from `i + 1` to `size - 1`.
   - For each `j`, check whether an arithmetic triplet `(i, j, k)` exists by iterating through the remaining elements of the array using a loop variable `k` from `j + 1` to `size - 1`.
   - Check if both conditions `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff` and `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff` are met. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the `count` variable by 1 to count the found triplet, set `found` to `True`, and break out of the innermost loop to avoid counting duplicate triplets with the same `i` and `j` values.

4. After completing the inner loops for a specific `i`, continue to the next `i` value and repeat the process.

5. Finally, return the `count` variable, which contains the total number of unique arithmetic triplets found.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution uses three nested loops to iterate through the `nums` array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).

#### Summary

The provided solution employs a brute-force approach to find and count unique arithmetic triplets in the `nums` array. It uses three nested loops to check all possible triplets and verifies whether they meet the required conditions. While the solution is correct, its time complexity is not efficient for larger input sizes, and there are more efficient approaches available for solving this problem.


### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def arithmeticTriplets(self, nums: List[int], diff: int) -> int:
        seen = set()
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            seen.add(num)
            if num - diff in seen and num - 2 * diff in seen:
                count += 1
        return count
```

The solution aims to find the number of unique arithmetic triplets in the `nums` array. To achieve this, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers seen so far. The idea is to iterate through the `nums` array, adding each number to the set as we go. For each number `num`, we check if both `num - diff` and `num - 2 * diff` are present in the set. If they are, it means we have found a valid arithmetic triplet, and we increment the count. We continue this process for each number in the array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of numbers seen so far and a count variable `count` to store the number of arithmetic triplets.

2. Iterate through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - Add `num` to the `seen` set.
   - Check if `num - diff` is in the `seen` set and if `num - 2 * diff` is also in the `seen` set. If both conditions are met, increment the `count` by 1.

3. After iterating through the entire array, return the final value of `count` as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the `nums` array once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, all elements of the `nums` array may be added to the `seen` set.

#### Summary

The solution efficiently finds the number of unique arithmetic triplets in the `nums` array by iterating through the array and checking for valid triplets using a set. The time complexity of the solution is linear in the size of the array, making it an efficient solution.
