# [1605. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-valid-matrix-given-row-and-column-sums/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium


You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the `ith` row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements of the `jth` column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.
Find any matrix of **non-negative** integers of size `rowSum.length x colSum.length` that satisfies the `rowSum` and `colSum` requirements.
Return *a 2D array representing **any** matrix that fulfills the requirements*. It's guaranteed that **at least one** matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rowSum = [3,8], colSum = [4,7]
Output: [[3,0],
         [1,7]]
Explanation:
0th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]
1st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]
0th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]
1st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]
The row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.
Another possible matrix is: [[1,2],
                             [3,5]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rowSum = [5,7,10], colSum = [8,6,8]
Output: [[0,5,0],
         [6,1,0],
         [2,0,8]]
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= rowSum.length, colSum.length <= 500`
- `0 <= rowSum[i], colSum[i] <= 108`
- `sum(rowSum) == sum(colSum)`


## Solutions

### O(nxm) of solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def restoreMatrix(self, rowSum: List[int], colSum: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        row_length, col_length = len(rowSum), len(colSum)

        matrix = [[0] * col_length for _ in range(row_length)]
        for row_index in range(row_length):
            for col_index in range(col_length):
                matrix[row_index][col_index] = min(rowSum[row_index], colSum[col_index])
                rowSum[row_index] -= matrix[row_index][col_index]
                colSum[col_index] -= matrix[row_index][col_index]
        
        return matrix
```

The solution aims to construct a matrix that satisfies the given row and column sum constraints. It does so iteratively by filling in the matrix row by row, ensuring that the row sum and column sum requirements are met.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize variables `row_length` and `col_length` to store the lengths of `rowSum` and `colSum`, respectively.

2. Create an empty `matrix` as a 2D list with dimensions `row_length x col_length`, filled with zeros. This will be the matrix to be constructed.

3. Iterate through each row and column of the `matrix` and fill in each cell with the minimum value between `rowSum[row_index]` and `colSum[col_index]`. This ensures that both the row and column sums are satisfied, and it uses as many zeros as possible.

4. Update `rowSum[row_index]` and `colSum[col_index]` by subtracting the value that was just added to the cell to maintain the correct sum values for the next iterations.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all rows and columns of the `matrix` until all cells have been filled.

6. Return the `matrix` as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through each cell in the `matrix` exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(row_length x col_length).

- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(row_length x col_length) due to the `matrix` variable.

#### Summary

The solution efficiently constructs a matrix that satisfies the given row and column sum requirements by iteratively filling in the cells while ensuring the constraints are met. The time complexity is linear in the size of the matrix, making it an efficient solution.
