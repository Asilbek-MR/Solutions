# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

Remove every node which has a node with a **strictly greater** value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return *the* `head` *of the modified linked list.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![062_01.png](./resources/062_01.png)

```
Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
Output: [13,8]
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,1,1,1]
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverse(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        new_head = None
        while head:
            node = head
            head = head.next
            node.next = new_head
            new_head = node
        return new_head

    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        queue = None
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if queue and queue.val < curr.val:
                while queue and queue.val < curr.val:
                    queue = queue.next

            temp = ListNode(curr.val)
            temp.next = queue
            queue = temp
            curr = curr.next
        return self.reverse(queue)
```

The given solution provides an approach to remove nodes from the linked list based on the given condition.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Create a function `reverse` that reverses a linked list. This function will be used to reverse the modified list at the end.
2. Initialize a `queue` variable to store the nodes that satisfy the condition. Set it to `None`.
3. Initialize a `curr` variable to traverse the original list starting from the head.
4. While traversing the list:
   - If the `queue` is not empty and the value of the `queue` node is less than the value of the current node (`queue.val < curr.val`), remove the nodes from the `queue` until a node with a greater or equal value is found.
   - Create a new node (`temp`) with the value of the current node and set its `next` pointer to the current `queue`.
   - Update the `queue` to point to the new node (`queue = temp`).
   - Move to the next node in the original list (`curr = curr.next`).
5. Reverse the `queue` using the `reverse` function.
6. Return the head of the reversed `queue`, which will be the head of the modified list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once, visiting each node at most once.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of additional space to store the pointers.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an approach to remove nodes from a linked list based on a given condition. It maintains a `queue` of nodes that satisfy the condition and reverses the modified list at the end. The solution runs in linear time and constant space complexity.
