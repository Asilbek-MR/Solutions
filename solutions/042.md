# [2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of 
integers **separated** by `0`'s. The **beginning** and **end** of the 
linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For **every** two consecutive `0`'s, **merge** all the nodes lying in 
between them into a single node whose value is the **sum** of all the 
merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return *the* `head` *of the modified linked list*.

## Example:

**Example 1:**

![41_1.png](./resources/41_1.png)

```
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

```

**Example 2:**

![41_2.png](./resources/41_2.png)

```
Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- There are **no** two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
- The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        target = head
        while target and target.next:
            if target.next.val:
                target.val += target.next.val
                target.next = target.next.next
            else:
                if target.next.next is None:
                    target.next = None
                target = target.next
        return head
```

The provided code implements a function called `mergeNodes` that merges consecutive non-zero nodes in a linked list and returns the modified list. Here's an analysis of the code, considering the given problem statement and constraints:

1. **Variable Initialization**: The algorithm initializes a variable named `target` with the value of the `head` node. This operation has constant time complexity.

2. **Node Merging**: The algorithm enters a `while` loop that continues until `target` becomes `None` or `target.next` becomes `None`. Within each iteration, it performs the following steps:
   - Non-Zero Node Merge: If the value of `target.next` is non-zero (`target.next.val`), the algorithm adds the value of `target.next` to `target` (`target.val += target.next.val`) and updates the `next` pointer of `target` to skip the merged node (`target.next = target.next.next`).
   - Zero Node Handling: If the value of `target.next` is zero (`target.next.val == 0`), the algorithm checks if the next node after `target.next` is the last node (`target.next.next is None`). If it is, the algorithm sets `target.next` to `None` to remove the zero node at the end of the linked list. Otherwise, the algorithm updates `target` to move to the next node (`target = target.next`).
   These steps are repeated until the end of the linked list is reached or a zero node is encountered. Each iteration in this loop has constant time complexity.

3. **Result Return**: Finally, the algorithm returns the `head` of the modified linked list. This operation has constant time complexity.

Considering the given problem statement and constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 10^5].
- The values of the nodes range from 0 to 1000.
- There are no two consecutive nodes with a value of 0.
- The beginning and end of the linked list have a value of 0.

The algorithm effectively merges consecutive non-zero nodes in the linked list and removes the zero nodes between them. It handles the special case of a zero node at the end of the linked list. The algorithm's performance remains efficient within these constraints. Since the number of nodes can be at most 2 * 10^5, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm does not utilize additional memory that scales with the input size.

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.

The algorithm successfully merges consecutive non-zero nodes in the linked list and returns the modified list. It adheres to the given constraints, ensuring efficient computation for linked lists of various sizes.
