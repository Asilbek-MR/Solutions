# [2326. Spiral Matrix IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given two integers `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.

You are also given the `head` of a linked list of integers.

Generate an `m x n` matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in **spiral** order **(clockwise)**, starting from the **top-left** of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

Return *the generated matrix*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![058_01.jpg](./resources/058_01.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.

```

**Example 2:**

![059_01.jpg](./resources/059_01.jpg)

```
Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `1 <= m * n <= 105`
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, m * n]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

    def spiralMatrix(self, m: int, n: int, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        matrix = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

        low_n, hi_n = 0, n-1
        low_m, hi_m = 0, m-1
        curr_n, curr_m = low_n, low_m

        curr = head
        while curr and curr.next:
            # Walk to the right
            print(curr_m, curr_n, low_m, hi_m, low_n, hi_n, curr.val)
            while curr and curr_n < hi_n:
                matrix[curr_m][curr_n] = curr.val
                curr = curr.next
                curr_n += 1
            hi_n -= 1

            # Walk to the down
            while curr and curr_m < hi_m:
                matrix[curr_m][curr_n] = curr.val
                curr = curr.next
                curr_m += 1
            hi_m -= 1
            
            # Walk to the left
            while curr and curr_n > low_n:
                matrix[curr_m][curr_n] = curr.val
                curr = curr.next
                curr_n -= 1
            low_n += 1

            # Walk to the up
            while curr and curr_m > low_m:
                matrix[curr_m][curr_n] = curr.val
                curr = curr.next
                curr_m -= 1
            low_m += 1

            curr_n, curr_m = low_n, low_m

        if curr:
            matrix[curr_n][curr_m] = curr.val

        return matrix
```

The given solution provides an approach to generate a matrix from the linked list in a spiral order.

Here is an overview of the solution:

1. Create a matrix of size m x n filled with -1.
2. Initialize variables for the boundaries of the matrix: `low_n` (lowest column index), `hi_n` (highest column index), `low_m` (lowest row index), and `hi_m` (highest row index). Initialize them to the initial boundaries of the matrix: `low_n = 0`, `hi_n = n-1`, `low_m = 0`, `hi_m = m-1`.
3. Initialize variables for the current position in the matrix: `curr_n` (current column index) and `curr_m` (current row index). Initialize them to the top-left corner of the matrix: `curr_n = low_n`, `curr_m = low_m`.
4. Traverse the linked list using a loop until there are no more nodes or only one node remaining.
   - Walk to the right: Fill the values from `curr_n` to `hi_n` in the current row (`curr_m`) of the matrix with the values from the linked list nodes. Update `curr_n` and move to the next node in the linked list.
   - Update the `hi_n` boundary to exclude the row that has been filled.
   - Walk down: Fill the values from `curr_m` to `hi_m` in the current column (`curr_n`) of the matrix with the values from the linked list nodes. Update `curr_m` and move to the next node in the linked list.
   - Update the `hi_m` boundary to exclude the column that has been filled.
   - Walk to the left: Fill the values from `curr_n` to `low_n` in the current row (`curr_m`) of the matrix with the values from the linked list nodes. Update `curr_n` and move to the next node in the linked list.
   - Update the `low_n` boundary to exclude the row that has been filled.
   - Walk up: Fill the values from `curr_m` to `low_m` in the current column (`curr_n`) of the matrix with the values from the linked list nodes. Update `curr_m` and move to the next node in the linked list.
   - Update the `low_m` boundary to exclude the column that has been filled.
   - Update `curr_n` and `curr_m` to the new boundaries: `curr_n = low_n`, `curr_m = low_m`.
5. If there is a remaining node in the linked list, fill the value in the matrix at position `(curr_m, curr_n)` with the value of the node.
6. Return the generated matrix.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(m * n) because we iterate over each cell of the matrix once.

The space complexity is O(m * n) because we create a matrix of size m x n.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an approach to generate a matrix from a linked list in a spiral order. It initializes the boundaries and the current position in the matrix, and then traverses the linked list, filling the matrix cells in a spiral pattern. The solution runs in quadratic time and space complexity.
