# [1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

There are `3n` piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

- In each step, you will choose **any** `3` piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
- You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.

Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the `ith` pile.

Return the maximum number of coins that you can have.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation:Choose the triplet (2, 7, 8), Alice Pick the pile with 8 coins, you the pile with7 coins and Bob the last one.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 4), Alice Pick the pile with 4 coins, you the pile with2 coins and Bob the last one.
The maximum number of coins which you can have are: 7 + 2 = 9.
On the other hand if we choose this arrangement (1,2, 8), (2,4, 7) you only get 2 + 4 = 6 coins which is not optimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [2,4,5]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [9,8,7,6,5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 18
```


## Constraints:

- `3 <= piles.length <= 105`
- `piles.length % 3 == 0`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:
        total = len(piles)
        start = total // 3
        piles.sort()

        return sum([piles[index] for index in range(start, total, 2)])
```

The solution provides an algorithm to maximize the number of coins you can have based on the described picking process.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Sort the `piles` array in ascending order.

2. To maximize the number of coins you can have, you need to pick the middle `n` piles out of the `3n` piles.

3. You want to pick the largest pile from each group of 3 consecutive piles, and Alice will always pick the largest of the 3.

4. To achieve this, you can start from the middle of the sorted array and iterate with a step size of 2 (to skip the pile picked by Alice). You sum up these picked piles.

5. Return the sum as the maximum number of coins you can have.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of piles.

The space complexity is O(1) since we're not using any extra space that grows with the input.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an approach to maximize the number of coins you can have by strategically choosing piles based on the picking process described in the problem. Sorting the array and then picking piles with a step size of 2 helps achieve the maximum coins. The solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting.
