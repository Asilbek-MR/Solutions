# [1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

On a 2D plane, there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return *the **minimum time** in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by* `points`.

You can move according to these rules:

- In `1` second, you can either:
    - move vertically by one unit,
    - move horizontally by one unit, or
    - move diagonally `sqrt(2)` units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in `1` second).
- You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
- You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![197_01.png](./resources/197_01.png)

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation:One optimal path is[1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] ->[3,4]-> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] ->[-1,0]
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```


## Constraints:

- `points.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = len(points)
        min_time = 0

        for index in range(1, count):
            x0, y0 = points[index-1]
            x1, y1 = points[index]
            digonally_travel_time = min(abs(x1-x0), abs(y1-y0))
            vertical_or_horizontal_travel_time = max(abs(x1-x0), abs(y1-y0)) - digonally_travel_time
            min_time += digonally_travel_time + vertical_or_horizontal_travel_time
        
        return min_time
```

The solution iterates through the list of points in order, starting from the second point and moving to subsequent points. For each pair of consecutive points (points[i-1] and points[i]), it calculates the minimum time required to move from the first point to the second point using the allowed movements: vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.

Here's how the solution works:

1. Initialize variables `min_time` to 0 and `count` to the number of points.
2. Iterate through the points starting from the second point (index 1) to the last point (index `count-1`). For each pair of consecutive points (points[i-1] and points[i]), do the following:
   - Calculate the absolute differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points: `dx = abs(x1 - x0)` and `dy = abs(y1 - y0)`.
   - Calculate the minimum time required to move diagonally from the first point to the second point. This is equal to the minimum of `dx` and `dy`, as each diagonal move covers √2 units. Store this value in `diagonal_travel_time`.
   - Calculate the time required to move either vertically or horizontally from the first point to the second point. This is equal to the maximum of `dx` and `dy` minus the diagonal travel time. Store this value in `vertical_or_horizontal_travel_time`.
   - Add `diagonal_travel_time` and `vertical_or_horizontal_travel_time` together and increment `min_time` by this sum. This represents the minimum time required to move from the first point to the second point.
3. After iterating through all points, the `min_time` variable contains the minimum time required to visit all the points in the given order.
4. Return the value of `min_time` as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the list of points once, performing constant-time calculations for each pair of consecutive points. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of points.
- Space Complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of additional space to store variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively calculates the minimum time required to visit a series of points on a 2D plane following specific movement rules. It iterates through the points, calculates the travel time for each pair of consecutive points, and accumulates the total minimum travel time. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
