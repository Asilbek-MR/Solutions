# [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You 
must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes 
(i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![056_01.jpg](./resources/056_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        prev, curr, new_head = None, head, head.next

        while curr and curr.next:
            temp = curr.next
            if prev: prev.next = temp

            curr.next, temp.next = temp.next, curr
            prev, curr = curr, curr.next

        return new_head
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to swap every two adjacent nodes in the linked list.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Check if the given linked list is empty or contains only one node. If so, return the head as it is.
2. Initialize three pointers: `prev` to keep track of the previous node, `curr` to keep track of the current node, and `new_head` to store the new head of the modified list.
3. Assign the `new_head` as the second node in the original list (`head.next`).
4. Enter a loop to swap every two adjacent nodes:
   - Store the reference to the next node after `curr` in the variable `temp`.
   - If `prev` is not `None`, update `prev.next` to point to `temp`.
   - Swap the positions of `curr` and `temp` by updating the `next` pointers accordingly: `curr.next` becomes `temp.next`, and `temp.next` becomes `curr`.
   - Update `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to the next node (`curr.next`).
5. Return the `new_head`, which is the head of the modified list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once and perform constant time operations.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of additional space to store the pointers.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an iterative approach to swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list. It maintains three pointers to keep track of the previous node, the current node, and the new head of the modified list. The solution runs in linear time and constant space complexity.
