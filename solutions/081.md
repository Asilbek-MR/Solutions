# [637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array*. 
Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![081_01.jpeg](081_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

**Example 2:**

![081_01.jpeg](081_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the rangeÂ `[1, 104]`.
- `231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`


## Solutions

### Name of solution 

**Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def averageOfLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[float]:
        result, level = [], [root]
        
        while level:
            result.append(sum([node.val for node in level])/len(level))
            level = [node.left for node in level if node.left] + [node.right for node in level if node.right]
        
        return result
```

The given solution provides a recursive approach to check if the value of the root node is equal to the sum of the values of its two children.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Check if the root node is None. If it is, return False as there is no node to check.
2. Check if the value of the root node is equal to the sum of the values of its left and right children.
3. Recursively call the `checkTree` function for the left child of the root.
4. Recursively call the `checkTree` function for the right child of the root.
5. Return the result of the logical AND operation between step 2 and the results from steps 3 and 4.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(1) because we are only dealing with a fixed number of nodes (3 nodes) in the binary tree.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional space that grows with the input.

#### Summary

The given solution provides a simple approach to check if the value of the root node in a binary tree is equal to the sum of the values of its two children. It recursively traverses the tree and performs the required checks. The solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1).
