# [705. Design HashSet](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement `MyHashSet` class:

- `void add(key)` Inserts the value `key` into the HashSet.
- `bool contains(key)` Returns whether the value `key` exists in the HashSet or not.
- `void remove(key)` Removes the value `key` in the HashSet. If `key` does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

## Example:

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyHashSet", "add", "add", "contains", "contains", "add", "contains", "remove", "contains"]
[[], [1], [2], [1], [3], [2], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, true, false, null, true, null, false]

Explanation
MyHashSet myHashSet = new MyHashSet();
myHashSet.add(1);      // set = [1]
myHashSet.add(2);      // set = [1, 2]
myHashSet.contains(1); // return True
myHashSet.contains(3); // return False, (not found)
myHashSet.add(2);      // set = [1, 2]
myHashSet.contains(2); // return True
myHashSet.remove(2);   // set = [1]
myHashSet.contains(2); // return False, (already removed)
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= key <= 106`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `add`, `remove`, and `contains`.

## Solutions

### Example solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.next = None

class MyHashSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capacity = 100
        self.bucket = [None] * self.capacity

    def _hash(self, key: int) -> int:
        prime = 97
        return (key * prime) % self.capacity

    def add(self, key: int) -> None:
        index = self._hash(key)
        if self.bucket[index] is None:
            self.bucket[index] = ListNode(key)
        else:
            curr = self.bucket[index]
            while curr:
                if curr.key == key:
                    return
                if curr.next is None:
                    break
                curr = curr.next
            curr.next = ListNode(key)

    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:
        index = self._hash(key)
        curr = self.bucket[index]
        while curr:
            if curr.key == key:
                return True
            curr = curr.next
        return False

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        index = self._hash(key)
        prev = None
        curr = self.bucket[index]
        while curr:
            if curr.key == key:
                if prev:
                    prev.next = curr.next
                else:
                    self.bucket[index] = curr.next
                return
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next

# Your MyHashSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyHashSet()
# obj.add(key)
# obj.remove(key)
# param_3 = obj.contains(key)
```

The given solution uses a simple implementation of a HashSet using a hash function and an array of linked lists.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a `ListNode` class that represents a node in the linked list. Each node contains a `key` and a reference to the next node (`next`).
2. Initialize the `MyHashSet` class with a fixed capacity of 100 and an array called `bucket` of size `capacity` to store the linked lists.
3. Implement a private `_hash` function that takes a `key` as input and returns the hash value (index) based on a prime number and the capacity of the HashSet.
4. Implement the `add` method that adds a `key` to the HashSet:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - If the bucket at the calculated index is `None`, create a new `ListNode` with the `key` and assign it to the bucket.
   - If the bucket at the calculated index is not `None`, iterate through the linked list at that index:
     - If the current node's `key` is equal to the `key` we want to add, return (no duplicates are allowed).
     - If the current node's `next` is `None`, break the loop and add a new `ListNode` with the `key` at the end of the linked list.
5. Implement the `contains` method that checks if a `key` exists in the HashSet:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - Iterate through the linked list at the calculated index and check if any node's `key` matches the given `key`. If found, return `True`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.
6. Implement the `remove` method that removes a `key` from the HashSet:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - Iterate through the linked list at the calculated index:
     - If the current node's `key` is equal to the given `key`, update the previous node's `next` reference to skip the current node and remove it from the linked list.
7. The `MyHashSet` class is now ready to be instantiated and used.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for the `add`, `contains`, and `remove` methods is O(1) on average. In the worst case, when there are many collisions and all keys are hashed to the same index, the time complexity becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the HashSet. However, since the capacity of the HashSet is fixed at 100, the worst case is limited.

The space complexity is O(capacity), where capacity is the fixed size of the HashSet (100). The space is used to store the array of linked lists.

#### Summary

The given solution implements a HashSet without using built-in hash table libraries. It uses a hash function and an array of linked lists to store the keys. The time complexity of the `add`, `contains`, and `remove` methods is O(1) on average. The space complexity is O(capacity), where capacity is the fixed size of the HashSet.
