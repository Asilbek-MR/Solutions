# [804. Unique Morse Code Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-morse-code-words/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:

- `'a'` maps to `".-"`,
- `'b'` maps to `"-..."`,
- `'c'` maps to `"-.-."`, and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the `26` letters of the English alphabet is given below:

```
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
```

Given an array of strings `words` where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.

- For example, `"cab"` can be written as `"-.-..--..."`, which is the concatenation of `"-.-."`, `".-"`, and `"-..."`. We will call such a concatenation the **transformation** of a word.

Return *the number of different **transformations** among all words we have*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["gin","zen","gig","msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."
There are 2 different transformations: "--...-." and "--...--.".

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a"]
Output: 1

```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 12`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.


## Solutions

### O(n*m) solution

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def uniqueMorseRepresentations(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        char_to_morse = [
            ".-", "-...", "-.-.", "-..", ".", "..-.", "--.", "....", "..", ".---", "-.-", ".-..",
            "--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."
        ] 

        seen = set()
        for word in words:
            morse = []
            for char in word:
                morse.append(char_to_morse[ord(char)-ord('a')])
            seen.add("".join(morse))
        return len(seen)
            
```

The given solution provides an approach to count the number of different transformations using Morse code for the given words.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a list `char_to_morse` that maps each character to its Morse code representation.
2. Initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of unique Morse code transformations.
3. Iterate through each word in the input array `words`.
4. For each character in the word, convert it to its corresponding Morse code using the `char_to_morse` list and append it to a list `morse`.
5. Join the elements of the `morse` list to form the Morse code transformation for the current word.
6. Add the transformation to the `seen` set.
7. Return the number of unique Morse code transformations, which is the size of the `seen` set.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word. We iterate through each word and, for each word, through each character.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words. This is because we use a set to store unique Morse code transformations.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an approach to count the number of different transformations using Morse code for the given words. It iterates through the words, converts each character to its corresponding Morse code, and keeps track of unique transformations. The solution has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word.
