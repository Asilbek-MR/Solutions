# [706. Design HashMap](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the `MyHashMap` class:

- `MyHashMap()` initializes the object with an empty map.
- `void put(int key, int value)` inserts a `(key, value)` pair into the HashMap. If the `key` already exists in the map, update the corresponding `value`.
- `int get(int key)` returns the `value` to which the specified `key` is mapped, or `1` if this map contains no mapping for the `key`.
- `void remove(key)` removes the `key` and its corresponding `value` if the map contains the mapping for the `key`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]

```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= key, value <= 106`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `put`, `get`, and `remove`.

## Solutions

### Example solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class MyHashMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capacity = 101
        self.bucket = [None] * self.capacity

    def _hash(self, key: int) -> int:
        return hash(key) % self.capacity

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        index = self._hash(key)
        if self.bucket[index] is None:
            self.bucket[index] = ListNode(key, value)
        else:
            curr = self.bucket[index]
            while curr:
                if curr.key == key:
                    curr.value = value
                    return
                if curr.next is None:
                    break
                curr = curr.next
            curr.next = ListNode(key, value)

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        index = self._hash(key)
        curr = self.bucket[index]
        while curr:
            if curr.key == key:
                return curr.value
            curr = curr.next
        return -1

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        index = self._hash(key)
        prev = None
        curr = self.bucket[index]
        while curr:
            if curr.key == key:
                if prev:
                    prev.next = curr.next
                else:
                    self.bucket[index] = curr.next
                return
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next

# Your MyHashMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyHashMap()
# obj.put(key,value)
# param_2 = obj.get(key)
# obj.remove(key)
```

The given solution uses a simple implementation of a HashMap using a hash function and an array of linked lists.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a `ListNode` class that represents a node in the linked list. Each node contains a `key`, a `value`, and a reference to the next node (`next`).
2. Initialize the `MyHashMap` class with a fixed capacity of 101 and an array called `bucket` of size `capacity` to store the linked lists.
3. Implement a private `_hash` function that takes a `key` as input and returns the hash value (index) based on the built-in `hash` function and the capacity of the HashMap.
4. Implement the `put` method that adds or updates a `(key, value)` pair in the HashMap:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - If the bucket at the calculated index is `None`, create a new `ListNode` with the `key` and `value` and assign it to the bucket.
   - If the bucket at the calculated index is not `None`, iterate through the linked list at that index:
     - If the current node's `key` is equal to the `key` we want to put, update the `value` of the current node and return (no duplicates are allowed).
     - If the current node's `next` is `None`, break the loop and add a new `ListNode` with the `key` and `value` at the end of the linked list.
5. Implement the `get` method that returns the value associated with a given `key` in the HashMap:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - Iterate through the linked list at the calculated index and check if any node's `key` matches the given `key`. If found, return the `value` of that node.
   - If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1.
6. Implement the `remove` method that removes a `(key, value)` pair from the HashMap:
   - Calculate the hash value using the `_hash` function.
   - Iterate through the linked list at the calculated index:
     - If the current node's `key` is equal to the given `key`, update the previous node's `next` reference to skip the current node and remove it from the linked list.
7. The `MyHashMap` class is now ready to be instantiated and used.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for the `put`, `get`, and `remove` methods is O(1) on average. In the worst case, when there are many collisions and all keys are hashed to the same index, the time complexity becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the HashMap. However, since the capacity of the HashMap is fixed at 101, the worst case is limited.

The space complexity is O(capacity + n), where capacity is the fixed size of the HashMap (101) and n is the number of elements in the HashMap. The space is used to store the array of linked lists and the nodes in the linked lists.

#### Summary

The given solution implements a HashMap without using built-in hash table libraries. It uses a hash function and an array of linked lists to store the `(key, value)` pairs. The time complexity of the `put`, `get`, and `remove` methods is O(1) on average. The space complexity is O(capacity + n), where capacity is the fixed size of the HashMap and n is the number of elements in the HashMap.
