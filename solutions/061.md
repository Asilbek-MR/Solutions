# [203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return *the new head*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![061_01.jpg](./resources/061_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []

```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`



## Solutions

### O(n) solution

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        new_head = ListNode()
        new_head.next = head
        
        prev, curr = new_head, new_head.next
        while curr:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        return new_head.next
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to remove all nodes with the value `val` from the linked list.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Create a new head node and set its `next` pointer to the original head of the linked list. This step allows handling the case where the head itself needs to be removed.
2. Initialize two pointers: `prev` to keep track of the previous node and `curr` to iterate through the list starting from the head.
3. Traverse the linked list using the `curr` pointer:
   - If the value of the current node (`curr.val`) is equal to `val`, update the `next` pointer of the previous node (`prev.next`) to skip the current node.
   - Otherwise, update both `prev` and `curr` to move forward in the list.
4. Return the `next` pointer of the new head, which will be the head of the modified list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once, visiting each node at most once.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of additional space to store the pointers.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an iterative approach to remove all nodes with a specific value from a linked list. It maintains two pointers to keep track of the previous node and the current node. The solution runs in linear time and constant space complexity.
