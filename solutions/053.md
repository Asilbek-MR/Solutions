# [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![053_01.jpg](./resources/053_01.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

![053_02.jpg](./resources/053_02.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pointer = head
        while pointer and pointer.next:
            if pointer.val == pointer.next.val:
                pointer.next = pointer.next.next
                continue
            pointer = pointer.next
        return head
```

The given solution approach removes duplicates from a sorted linked list. It follows these steps:

1. Initialize a pointer `pointer` to the head of the linked list.
2. Iterate through the linked list using the `pointer` and `pointer.next` pointers.
3. If the value of `pointer` is equal to the value of `pointer.next`, it means there is a duplicate.
   - Skip the duplicate by updating `pointer.next` to `pointer.next.next`.
   - Continue to the next iteration.
4. If the values are not equal, move the `pointer` to the next node.
5. Return the head of the modified linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we traverse through all the nodes of the linked list once.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution removes duplicates from a sorted linked list. It iterates through the linked list, skips duplicates by updating the pointers, and returns the head of the modified linked list. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
