# [145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the postorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![069_01.jpeg](./resources/069_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

```

## Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Follow up:

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python 3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []

        result, stack = [], [root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            result.append(node.val)

            if node.left:
                stack.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                stack.append(node.right)

        return result[::-1]
```

The given solution provides an iterative approach to perform a postorder traversal of a binary tree.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Check if the root is None. If it is, return an empty list as there are no nodes to traverse.
2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the postorder traversal and a stack with the root node.
3. Enter a loop that continues until the stack is not empty:
   - Pop a node from the stack.
   - Append the value of the node to the `result`.
   - If the node has a left child, push the left child to the stack.
   - If the node has a right child, push the right child to the stack.
4. Reverse the `result` list.
5. Return the `result`, which contains the postorder traversal of the binary tree.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the stack can contain all nodes along the path from the root to the leftmost leaf.

#### Summary

The given solution provides an iterative approach to perform a postorder traversal of a binary tree. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit and appends the node values to the result list in postorder. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes and h is the height of the binary tree.
