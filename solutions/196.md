# [46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return *all the possible permutations*. You can return the answer in **any order**.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 6`
- `10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.


## Solutions

### O(n!) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        size = len(nums)
        if size == 1:
            return [nums]

        permutations = []
        for i in range(size):
            num = nums[i]
            remaining_nums = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]

            for permutation in self.permute(remaining_nums):
                permutations.append([num]+permutation)

        return permutations
```

The provided solution uses a recursive approach to generate all possible permutations of the input array `nums`. The key idea is to select one element from the array as the first element of each permutation and recursively generate permutations for the remaining elements. The base case occurs when the array has only one element, in which case the array itself is a valid permutation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `size` to store the length of the input array `nums`.

2. Check if the value of `size` is equal to 1. If `size` is 1, it means there is only one element in the array, so return a list containing the array itself as the only permutation. This serves as the base case for the recursion.

3. If `size` is greater than 1, create an empty list `permutations` to store the permutations.

4. Iterate through the elements of the `nums` array using a loop variable `i` from 0 to `size-1`. For each element at index `i`, do the following:
   - Extract the element `num` at index `i`.
   - Create a new list `remaining_nums` that contains all elements of `nums` except the one at index `i`. This is done using list slicing.
   - Recursively call the `permute` function with the `remaining_nums` array to generate permutations for the remaining elements. The result is a list of lists representing permutations of the remaining elements.

5. For each generated permutation of the remaining elements, append the `num` element (selected in step 4) as the first element of the permutation. This creates a new permutation with `num` as the first element.

6. Repeat step 5 for all elements in the `nums` array, generating permutations for each possible starting element.

7. After the loop completes, the `permutations` list will contain all possible permutations of the `nums` array.

8. Return the `permutations` list as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution generates all possible permutations of the input array `nums`. The number of permutations is equal to `n!`, where `n` is the length of the array. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n!), where `n` is at most 6 (as given in the problem constraints). As the input size is small (n <= 6), the time complexity is manageable.

- Space Complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, and the space required for the `permutations` list is proportional to the number of permutations generated. Since there are `n!` permutations, the space complexity is O(n!) in the worst case.

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively generates all possible permutations of the input array `nums` using a recursive approach. It recursively selects one element as the first element of each permutation and generates permutations for the remaining elements. The base case is when there is only one element, in which case the array itself is returned as a permutation. The solution handles small input sizes efficiently.
