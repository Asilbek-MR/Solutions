# [2744. Find Maximum Number of String Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-maximum-number-of-string-pairs/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a **0-indexed** array `words` consisting of **distinct** strings.
The string `words[i]` can be paired with the string `words[j]` if:

- The string `words[i]` is equal to the reversed string of `words[j]`.
- `0 <= i < j < words.length`.

Return *the **maximum** number of pairs that can be formed from the array* `words`*.*
Note that each string can belong in **at most one** pair.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way:
- We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is "dc" and is equal to words[2].
- We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is "ca" and is equal to words[3].
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["ab","ba","cc"]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can form 1 pair of strings in the following way:
- We pair the 0th string with the 1st string, as the reversed string of words[1] is "ab" and is equal to words[0].
It can be proven that 1 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["aa","ab"]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, we are unable to form any pair of strings.
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `words[i].length == 2`
- `words` consists of distinct strings.
- `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.


## Solutions

### Name of solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def maximumNumberOfStringPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        count = 0
        for word in words:
            if word in seen:
                count += 1
            else:
                seen.add(word[::-1])
        return count
```

The provided solution uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the reversed versions of the words that have been encountered while iterating through the `words` array. The key idea is that if a word and its reverse are both present in the `words` array, they can form a valid pair.

Here's how the solution works:

1. Initialize an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the reversed versions of words that have been encountered.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
3. Iterate through the `words` array. For each word in the array, do the following:

   - Check if the reverse of the word (i.e., `word[::-1]`) is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, increment the `count` variable by 1, indicating that a valid pair has been found.

   - If the reverse of the word is not present in the `seen` set, add the reverse of the word to the `seen` set. This allows us to track this word for potential pairs in the future.
4. After iterating through all the words, the `count` variable contains the maximum number of valid pairs that can be formed.
5. Return the value of `count` as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the `words` array once and performs constant-time operations (reversing a word and set operations) for each word. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the `words` array.

- Space Complexity: The space complexity is determined by the size of the `seen` set. In the worst case, all words in the `words` array are unique and their reversed versions are added to the set. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the `words` array.

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively computes the maximum number of valid pairs that can be formed from an array of distinct strings. It uses a set to keep track of reversed versions of words and increments a count whenever a valid pair is found. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it efficient for the given constraints.
