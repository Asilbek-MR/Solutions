# [2482. Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/difference-between-ones-and-zeros-in-row-and-column/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

A **0-indexed** `m x n` difference matrix `diff` is created with the following procedure:

- Let the number of ones in the `ith` row be `onesRowi`.
- Let the number of ones in the `jth` column be `onesColj`.
- Let the number of zeros in the `ith` row be `zerosRowi`.
- Let the number of zeros in the `jth` column be `zerosColj`.
- `diff[i][j] = onesRowi + onesColj - zerosRowi - zerosColj`

Return *the difference matrix* `diff`.

## Solutions

### O(m x n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def onesMinusZeros(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        cols, rows = {}, {}

        for i in range(m):
            rows[i] = {0: grid[i].count(0), 1: grid[i].count(1)}

        for j in range(n):
            cols[j] = {0: 0, 1: 0}
            for i in range(m):
                cols[j][0] += 1 if grid[i][j] == 0 else 0
                cols[j][1] += 1 if grid[i][j] == 1 else 0
        
        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                matrix[i][j] = rows[i][1] + cols[j][1] - rows[i][0] - cols[j][0]

        return matrix 
```

The given solution constructs the difference matrix, `diff`, by calculating the differences between the counts of ones and zeros in each row and each column of the `grid`. It uses dictionaries to store the counts of ones and zeros for rows and columns.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize the dimensions of the `grid` as m (number of rows) and n (number of columns).
2. Initialize empty dictionaries, `cols` and `rows`, to store the counts of ones and zeros for columns and rows, respectively.
3. Iterate through each row of the `grid`:
   - Calculate the count of zeros and ones in the current row and store them in the `rows` dictionary.
4. Iterate through each column of the `grid`:
   - Initialize an empty dictionary, `cols[j]`, to store the counts of zeros and ones for the current column j.
   - Iterate through each row of the `grid`:
     - Update the counts of zeros and ones for the current column based on the value of the current element in the `grid`.
5. Create an empty `matrix` with dimensions m x n.
6. Iterate through each element of the `matrix`:
   - Calculate the difference between the counts of ones and zeros for the corresponding row and column and assign it to the current element of the `matrix`.
7. Return the `matrix`, which represents the difference matrix `diff`.

The algorithm calculates the counts of ones and zeros for each row and column and constructs the difference matrix based on these counts.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the `grid`. The algorithm iterates through each element of the `grid` and performs constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(m + n), as it uses additional space to store the `rows` and `cols` dictionaries, each with a maximum size of m or n, respectively. The `matrix` also requires O(m * n) space.

#### Summary

The given solution constructs a difference matrix `diff` by calculating the differences between the counts of ones and zeros in each row and each column of the binary matrix `grid`. It has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m + n + m * n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
