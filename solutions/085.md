# [872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence***.*

![083_01.jpeg](./resources/083_01.jpeg)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![083_02.jpeg](./resources/083_02.jpeg)

```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![083_03.jpeg](./resources/083_03.jpeg)

```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range `[1, 200]`.
- Both of the given trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`.

## Solutions

### O(n1+n2) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def leaves(node):
            if not node:
                return []

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return [node.val]

            return leaves(node.left) + leaves(node.right)

        return leaves(root1) == leaves(root2)
```

The given solution provides a recursive approach to check if two binary trees are leaf-similar.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Define a recursive function `leaves` that takes a node as an argument and returns the list of leaf node values in the tree rooted at that node.
2. Check if the node is None. If it is, return an empty list as there are no leaves.
3. Check if the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left and right children). If it is, return a list containing its value.
4. Recursively call the `leaves` function for the left child of the node and concatenate the result with the result of the recursive call for the right child.
5. Return the list obtained in step 4.

Finally, compare the lists of leaves for the two trees and return true if they are equal, indicating that the trees are leaf-similar.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n1 + n2), where n1 and n2 are the number of nodes in the two trees. We visit all the nodes in both trees to collect the leaf values.

The space complexity is O(h1 + h2), where h1 and h2 are the heights of the two trees. This is the maximum recursion depth.

#### Summary

The given solution provides a recursive approach to check if two binary trees are leaf-similar. It recursively collects the leaf node values in both trees and compares them to determine if the trees are leaf-similar. The solution has a time complexity of O(n1 + n2) and a space complexity of O(h1 + h2), where n1 and n2 are the number of nodes and h1 and h2 are the heights of the two trees.
