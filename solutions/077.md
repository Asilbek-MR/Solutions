# [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return *its root*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![077_01.jpeg](./resources/077_01.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

**Example 2:**

![077_02.jpeg](./resources/077_02.jpeg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `100 <= Node.val <= 100`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root:
            return root
        
        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root
```

The given solution provides a recursive approach to invert a binary tree.

Here is a step-by-step overview of the solution:

1. Check if the root is None. If it is, return None as there is no node to invert.
2. Swap the left and right child of the root node.
3. Recursively call the `invertTree` function for the left child of the root.
4. Recursively call the `invertTree` function for the right child of the root.
5. Return the root after swapping its left and right children.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is the recursion depth. In the worst case, the recursion depth can be equal to the height of the tree.

## Summary

The given solution provides a recursive approach to invert a binary tree. It recursively traverses the tree and swaps the left and right children of each node. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes and h is the height of the binary tree.
